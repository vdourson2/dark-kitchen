# Keller's burgers

## Becode exercise : building a Dark Kitchen online delivery service

### Team :

 - Justine
 - Virginie
 - Justin
 - Thomas

### first meeting :

We will use [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/0sryRVJK/ATTI91dc539af2045b2edc8f357dfda13d8e064EF88B/dark-kitchen) to manage tasks.

We choosed to determine together the main style of the project such as :

- Name : **Keller's Burgers**
- type of food : Burgers.
- global style : [See Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/iYWZR7I01XC9GETLZ01uhy/Dark-Kitchen?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=24Se2trkJHKn1hFd-1)

We had a lot of discussion to choose main theme and to choose features of the page.
--> the main goal was to have a **consensus**.

we have some "bonus features", we will implement it if we have the time:

 - Search bar
 - navbar like footer
 - burger cards details when click on it
 - graphic style ( logo, main title, we probably use a AI generated pictures for the main logo)

### Structure of the project:

We choosed to use a predefined layout for the sccs files [SCSS Playbook](https://github.com/tomboszko/Project-ScssPlaybook.git)

 - One person only in charge of create the index.html --> Virginie.
 - One person create the script files --> Justine.
 - We divided the entry of the objects, one cat. per person --> 16 burgers created.
 - We divided the team in two sub team:
   
    - Virginie & Tom for the homepage
    - Justin & Justine for the ''caddy''

 ### end of the day report 1 :

 Globally good start from the team, it's difficult to manage all the tasks and know where to start, maybe, for the first day, it would be more convenient to do it in "presentiel".
 
 - We found that using Trello is mandatory for tasks management, so we do.
 - Issue with the SCSS files directory --> some problems with the typo in certains folders.

to be continued...
